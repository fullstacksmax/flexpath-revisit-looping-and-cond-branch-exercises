/* 
Exercise 16: Logical Operator Precedence in Complex Conditions

Problem:

Write a function `validateInput` that accepts an object with 
properties 'username', 'password', and 'email'. 

The function should return true if:

- username and password are non-empty strings, and email contains an '@' symbol, 

or

- The user has a property isGuest set to true.


Use logical operators and parentheses to ensure the correct evaluation order.*/
