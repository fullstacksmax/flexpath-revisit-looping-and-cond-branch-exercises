Exercise 3: Switch Statement with Fallthrough

Problem:

Write a function `getShippingCost` that calculates shipping costs based 
on package weight. 

Use a switch statement with fallthrough to handle the following cases:

- For weights up to 1kg, the cost is $5.
- For weights above 1kg and up to 5kg, the cost is $10.
- For weights above 5kg and up to 10kg, the cost is $15.
- For weights above 10kg, the cost is $20.


Weights are categorized as:

1: up to 1kg
2: above 1kg up to 5kg
3: above 5kg up to 10kg
4: above 10kg

Implement the function so that it returns the 
correct shipping cost based on the weight category.*/

/*
console.log(getShippingCost(0.5)); // Outputs: 5
console.log(getShippingCost(3)); // Outputs: 10
console.log(getShippingCost(7)); // Outputs: 15
console.log(getShippingCost(12)); // Outputs: 20
*/
