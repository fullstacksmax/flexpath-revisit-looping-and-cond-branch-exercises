/*
Exercise 20: Advanced Use of Increment and Decrement Operators

Problem:

Create a class `CircularCounter` that counts from 0 up to 
a maximum value 'max' and then wraps around to 0 when incremented. 

Implement 'increment' and 'decrement' methods using prefix and postfix forms of 
the increment/decrement operators. 

Ensure that the counter behaves correctly at the boundaries. */
